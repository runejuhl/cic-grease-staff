* CIC Greasemonkey staff page thing

This is a Greasemonkey script to generate a better-looking and dynamic staff
page for Centre for Ice and Climate.

It's developed around 2014 and is basically a hack that allows a non-technical
person to be able to update the staff page in the CMS by "uploading" a CSV to
the running Greasemonkey extension which spits out a HTML/JS blob.

The repo also contains some attempts at automating the process, but I'm pretty
sure it never got into a working state.
